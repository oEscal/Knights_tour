# Knights_tour
My solution to the knight's tour's mathematical problem

## Description
 - One simple solution to this millennial problem
 - This repository also has two python documents, one to create the graphical chess boards calculated with c code, with the help of pygame library, and the other to make a board from 4 smaller boards with the same size, for a divide and conquer solution
 - This problem was introduced to me by my University algorithm's professor as a second problem to defend my grade in that subject

## Limitations
 - I didn't wrote the code for the divide and conquer algorithm, I just explained how to do one in the report

## Problems
 - The C code presented in this repository can have some unknown bugs, so if you find them, feel free to send me a report 
 - My english knowledge isn't the better, so I apologize for some errors that you can find in the code's comments
 - Report in portuguese
